\title{Gene Expression Correlations Amongst Tissue Samples.}
\usage{
tissue_pair_gene_expression(
  tissue_1_matrix,
  tissue_2_matrix,
  variance_percentage,
  correlation_method
)
}
\arguments{
\item{tissue_1_matrix}{A file containing gene-donor data of the first tissue}

\item{tissue_2_matrix}{A file containing gene-donor data of the second tissue}

\item{variance_percentage}{A decimal value requesting the percentage of the most variable genes}

\item{correlation_method}{Type of correlation method used for analysis. Choose amongst 'Pearson', 'Spearman', and 'Biweight Mid' correlation. 'Biweight Mid' is default.}
}
\value{
Graphics of gene correlations and a matrix p-values associated with analysis
}
\description{
A package that takes two gene data files and produces graphics and correlation information based on preferred method and gene variability. Methods include, 'pearson', 'Spearman', and 'Biweight MidCorrelation' where the biweight method is the default parameter. The operation and optimization of the function is still in progress
